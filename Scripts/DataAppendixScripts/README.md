# DataAppendixScripts Folder

## Overview

The `DataAppendixScripts` folder contains scripts specifically used to generate the Data Appendix documentation for the processed data files. These scripts automate the process of documenting all transformations and steps applied to the raw data, ensuring that the data appendix is comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date. The Data Appendix Scripts contain commands that generate the figures, tables, and other descriptive statistics that are presented in the Data Appendix.

## Contents

- **Data Appendix Scripts**: These scripts are designed to create detailed documentation of the data processing steps, including descriptions of the data files, transformation processes, figures, tables, and other descriptive statistics, and rationale for changes.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names for the scripts to indicate their specific roles in generating the Data Appendix.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each script is thoroughly documented with comments explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and key steps. Include any assumptions or important considerations.
  - **Header Comments**: At the beginning of each script, include a header with the script's name, author, date, and a brief description of its function.
  - **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain specific lines or sections of code that perform important or complex tasks.
- **Automation**: Design the scripts to automate as much of the documentation process as possible. This can include automatically extracting metadata from data files, summarizing transformation steps, and formatting the output documentation.
- **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular fashion to allow easy updates and reuse of code. Separate different documentation tasks into distinct scripts rather than combining everything into a single script.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in scripts. Document major changes and maintain a history of script versions.
