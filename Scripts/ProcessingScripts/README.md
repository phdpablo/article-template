# ProcessingScripts Folder

## Overview

The `ProcessingScripts` folder holds all scripts for initial processing and cleaning of raw data files. These scripts transform raw data from the `InputData` folder into intermediate forms stored in the `IntermediateData` folder. Good documentation and organization of these scripts are crucial for reproducibility and transparency of data processing.

## Contents

-   **Processing Scripts**: These scripts handle data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing. Each script should focus on a specific processing aspect, such as data merging, filtering, or formatting.

## Guidelines

-   **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names. Names should indicate specific processing tasks. Examples: `clean_data.R`, `merge_datasets.py`, `filter_outliers.R`.
-   **Documentation**: Document each script thoroughly with comments. Explain its purpose, inputs, outputs, and key steps. Note any assumptions or important considerations.
    -   **Header Comments**: Start each script with a header. Include the script name, author, date, and a brief function description.
    -   **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain specific lines or sections. This is important for complex tasks.
-   **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular way. This allows easy updates and code reuse. Separate different processing stages into distinct scripts.
-   **Version Control**: Use version control to track script changes. Record major changes and maintain a version history.
