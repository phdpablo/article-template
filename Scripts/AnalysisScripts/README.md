# AnalysisScripts Folder

## Overview

The `AnalysisScripts` folder holds all scripts for data analysis. These scripts transform intermediate or analysis data into final results and outputs. They apply various statistical or analytical methods. Good documentation and organization of these scripts are essential for analysis reproducibility and transparency.

## Contents

-   **Analysis Scripts**: These scripts perform analysis tasks. This includes statistical tests, data visualization, and result generation. Each script should focus on a specific analysis aspect.

## Guidelines

-   **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names. Names should indicate specific analysis tasks. Examples: `regression_analysis.R`, `data_visualization.py`, `summary_statistics.R`.
-   **Documentation**: Document each script thoroughly with comments. Explain its purpose, inputs, outputs, and key steps. Note any assumptions or important considerations.
    -   **Header Comments**: Start each script with a header. Include the script name, author, date, and a brief function description.
    -   **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain specific lines or sections. This is especially important for complex tasks.
-   **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular way. This allows easy updates and code reuse. Separate different analysis stages into distinct scripts.
-   **Version Control**: Use version control to track script changes. Record major changes and maintain a version history.
-   **Reproducibility**: Ensure each script can run independently. It should produce the same results with the same input data. Set random seeds where needed. Document dependencies or software requirements.
