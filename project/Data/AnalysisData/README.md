# AnalysisData Folder

## Overview

The `AnalysisData` folder contains the data files that have been processed and prepared for analysis. These files are derived from the raw data in the `InputData` folder and include any transformations, cleaning, or modifications necessary for the analysis. Additionally, this folder includes a complete definition and/or coding scheme, basic summary statistics, and a visualization of the distribution of every variable in your Analysis Data Files.

## Contents

### 1. Analysis Data Files
- **Purpose**: Store the processed data files ready for analysis.
- **Description**: These files have undergone necessary transformations and cleaning steps. They represent the data in a format suitable for conducting analyses.

### 2. The Data Appendix
- **Purpose**: Provide detailed documentation of the processed data files.
- **Contents**:
  - **Modification Logs**: Detailed records of all transformations, cleaning steps, and modifications applied to the raw data.
  - **Rationale**: Explanation of the reasons behind each modification, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
  - **File Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of each processed data file, including the structure, variables, and any changes from the original raw data.

## Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Ensure that every modification to the raw data is thoroughly documented in the Data Appendix. This should include the specific changes made, the tools and methods used, and the rationale behind these changes.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain the integrity and accuracy of the data throughout the processing steps. Any errors or anomalies discovered during processing should be documented and addressed appropriately.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent file naming conventions and data formats across all analysis data files to facilitate easy use and understanding.
