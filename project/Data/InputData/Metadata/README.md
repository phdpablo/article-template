# Metadata Folder

## Overview

The `Metadata` folder contains comprehensive documentation about the raw data sources and the data files themselves. This information is crucial for understanding the context, structure, and content of the data, ensuring that the research process is transparent and reproducible.

## Contents

### 1. Data Sources Guide
- **Purpose**: Provide detailed information about the origins of the data.
- **Contents**:
  - **Source Descriptions**: Information about where the data was obtained, including URLs, descriptions of data collection methods, and any relevant context about the data provider.
