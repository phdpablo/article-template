# InputData Folder

## Overview

The `InputData` folder contains the original, raw data files used as inputs for the analysis. This folder is crucial for ensuring the transparency and reproducibility of the research process. It includes the actual data files, as well as metadata providing detailed descriptions and documentation about the data sources.

## Contents

### 1. Input Data Files
- **Purpose**: Store the raw data files in their original format as received or downloaded from data sources.
- **Description**: These files should be untouched and unaltered from their original state. This allows for a clear starting point for any data processing or analysis steps.

### 2. Metadata
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive documentation about the data sources and the data itself.
- **Contents**:
  - **Data Sources Guide**: Detailed information about where the data came from, including any relevant URLs, descriptions of how the data was collected, and any associated data collection methodologies.
  - **Codebooks**: Documentation that explains the variables within the data files, including definitions, coding schemes, and any other relevant information that aids in understanding the data.

## Guidelines

- **File Organization**: Keep the original data files and their accompanying metadata well-organized and clearly named to facilitate easy identification and access.
- **Documentation**: Ensure thorough documentation for each data file, including its source, date of acquisition, and any relevant context needed for understanding its content.
- **Data Integrity**: Do not modify the raw data files in this folder. Any data cleaning or transformation should be done in subsequent steps and stored in different folders (e.g., `IntermediateData` or `AnalysisData`).
