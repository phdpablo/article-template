# DataAppendixOutput Folder

## Overview

The `DataAppendixOutput` folder contains the final documentation products that detail all the Data Appendix. There should be a direct match between the output displayed in your Data Appendix and the files in your `DataAppendixOutput`:

- Each output element utilized in your Data Appendix should be retained in one of the files in the `DataAppendixOutput`.
- Each file in the `DataAppendixOutput` directory should include some content that is presented in your Data Appendix.

## Contents

- **Data Appendix Files**: Detailed documentation files that describe the data sources, processing steps, transformations, and final analysis datasets. These files are typically generated by the `DataAppendixScripts`.
- **Supporting Documentation**: Any additional files that support the understanding and interpretation of the Data Appendix, such as methodological notes, transformation logs, and codebooks.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for the Data Appendix files to indicate their contents and purpose. For example, `data_appendix_main.pdf`, `transformation_log.xlsx`, `variable_definitions.txt`.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that each file is thoroughly documented with descriptions that explain its purpose, contents, and any important considerations or limitations.
  - **Header Comments**: For text-based files, include a header with the file's name, author, date, and a brief description of its contents.
  - **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions within the files to explain each aspect of the data processing and analysis steps.
- **Organization**: Keep the Data Appendix files organized in a logical structure to facilitate easy access and understanding. Group related files together and use subfolders if necessary.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in the Data Appendix files. Document major changes and maintain a history of versions.
