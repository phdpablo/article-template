This is main folder where the primary research documentation is located. Following the [TIER Protocol 4.0](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/) this is the folder that contains the research project documents:

**Article**: divided into `.qmd` files, each representing a section of the article's narrative. In this case:

-   `index.qmd`: Article metadata like title, subtitle, abstract, keywords, authors, etc. Do not change the file name as we need to generate the `index.html` file as the main page of the article website.

-   `01-intro.qmd`, `02-background.qmd`, `03-methods.qmd`, `04-results.qmd`, and `05-considerations.qmd` are the traditional sections of a scientific article. Put your narrative inside this files on RStudio/Quarto.

-   `references.qmd`: There is no need to edit this file. It is fed by the `reference.bib` file as you insert citations using Zotero, or a Better BibliTex key, for example.

-   When rendering the document, a PDF file with all sections, that is, the complete article will be generated in the `../docs` folder

**Data/**: Contains various versions of the data used in your project.

**Scripts/**: Contains scripts that execute the data processing and analysis that generate the results of your project.

-   Remember, the dynamic document is used only to report the analysis results. Following this approach, all the analysis steps are defined and managed outside of the dynamic document.

-   Therefore, you must show all the steps to get to where you are in the scripts, although in the body of the article you only document what you consider relevant. Check out how to include the output of an another [Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html) to avoid code redundancy.

**Output/**: Contains files that capture figures, tables, and other results generated by your scripts or external sources.

-   Some output are compiled into separate files and found in the `../docs` folder, others are not compiled and it may be interesting to document them all in one place. Even if the outputs are on the article's website (dynamic document), it may be relevant to archive copies with higher resolution quality, for example, or even outputs from external sources.

We following [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) convention to encode a name for the project subfolders.
