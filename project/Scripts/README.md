# Scripts Folder

## Overview

The `Scripts` folder contains all the scripts used in the project for data processing, analysis, and generating results. These scripts are organized into subfolders based on their specific functions and stages of the data workflow. Proper organization and documentation of these scripts are crucial for ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of the research process.

## Contents

### Subfolders

1. **ProcessingScripts**
   - **Purpose**: Contains scripts used for the initial processing and cleaning of the raw data files.
   - **Description**: These scripts transform raw data from the `InputData` folder into intermediate forms stored in the `IntermediateData` folder.

2. **DataAppendixScripts**
   - **Purpose**: Includes scripts specifically used to generate the Data Appendix documentation for the processed data files.
   - **Description**: These scripts automate the documentation process, ensuring that all transformations and steps are recorded accurately.

3. **AnalysisScripts**
   - **Purpose**: Contains scripts used for the actual data analysis, transforming intermediate data into final results.
   - **Description**: These scripts take intermediate data files and apply various statistical or analytical methods to produce the final analysis outputs stored in the `Output` folder.

### Master Script
- **Purpose**: Serves as the main script that orchestrates the execution of all other scripts.
- **Description**: This script typically runs all the processing, analysis, and documentation scripts in the correct order to reproduce the entire workflow from raw data to final results.

## Guidelines

- **Organization**: Keep scripts well-organized in their respective subfolders based on their functions. Use clear and descriptive names for scripts to reflect their purpose.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each script is thoroughly documented with comments explaining the purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key steps or assumptions. Include usage instructions if necessary.
- **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular fashion to allow easy updates and reuse of code. Separate different stages of processing and analysis into distinct scripts.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in scripts. Document major changes and maintain a history of script versions.
