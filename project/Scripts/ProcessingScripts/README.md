# ProcessingScripts Folder

## Overview

The `ProcessingScripts` folder contains all the scripts used for the initial processing and cleaning of the raw data files. These scripts transform raw data from the `InputData` folder into intermediate forms stored in the `IntermediateData` folder. Proper documentation and organization of these scripts are crucial for ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of the data processing steps.

## Contents

- **Processing Scripts**: These scripts include various data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing tasks. Each script should be designed to handle specific aspects of data processing, such as data merging, filtering, and formatting.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for the scripts to indicate their specific processing tasks. For example, `clean_data.R`, `merge_datasets.py`, `filter_outliers.R`.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each script is thoroughly documented with comments explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and key steps. Include any assumptions or important considerations.
  - **Header Comments**: At the beginning of each script, include a header with the script's name, author, date, and a brief description of its function.
  - **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain specific lines or sections of code that perform important or complex tasks.
- **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular fashion to allow easy updates and reuse of code. Separate different stages of processing into distinct scripts rather than combining everything into a single script.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in scripts. Document major changes and maintain a history of script versions.
