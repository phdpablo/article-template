# AnalysisScripts Folder

## Overview

The `AnalysisScripts` folder contains all the scripts used for data analysis. These scripts transform the intermediate or analysis data into final results and outputs, applying various statistical or analytical methods. Proper documentation and organization of these scripts are essential for ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of the analysis process.

## Contents

- **Analysis Scripts**: These scripts perform the analysis tasks, including statistical tests, data visualization, and generation of results. Each script should focus on specific aspects of the analysis.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for the scripts to indicate their specific analysis tasks. For example, `regression_analysis.R`, `data_visualization.py`, `summary_statistics.R`.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each script is thoroughly documented with comments explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and key steps. Include any assumptions or important considerations.
  - **Header Comments**: At the beginning of each script, include a header with the script's name, author, date, and a brief description of its function.
  - **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain specific lines or sections of code that perform important or complex tasks.
- **Modularity**: Write scripts in a modular fashion to allow easy updates and reuse of code. Separate different stages of analysis into distinct scripts rather than combining everything into a single script.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in scripts. Document major changes and maintain a history of script versions.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that each script can be run independently and that it produces the same results when executed with the same input data. This includes setting random seeds where applicable and documenting any dependencies or software requirements.
