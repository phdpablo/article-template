# IntermediateData Folder

## Overview

The `IntermediateData` folder contains data files that are generated during the processing steps but are not the final analysis data. These files are intermediary products of data transformations, cleaning, and other preprocessing steps. They serve as a bridge between the raw input data and the final analysis data, helping to document the evolution of the data throughout the research process.

## Contents

- **Intermediate Data Files**: These files capture various stages of data processing. They may include data that has been cleaned, merged, filtered, or otherwise transformed but is not yet in its final form for analysis.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent file names that reflect the processing stage and the specific transformations applied.
- **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation for each intermediate data file. This should include:
  - **Transformation Steps**: A detailed account of the transformations applied to generate each intermediate file.
  - **Rationale**: The reasoning behind each transformation step, including how it contributes to the overall analysis objectives.
  - **Version Control**: Keep track of different versions of intermediate data files if they are updated or modified during the project.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that data integrity is maintained at each processing stage. Document any issues encountered and the steps taken to resolve them.
