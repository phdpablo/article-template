# Metadata Folder

## Overview

The `Metadata` folder stores comprehensive documentation about the raw data sources and the data files themselves. This information is essential for understanding the context, structure, and content of the data. It supports transparency and reproducibility in the research process.

## Contents

### 1. Data Sources Guide

-   **Purpose**: Provide detailed information about the origins of the data.
-   **Contents**:
    -   **Source Descriptions**: Information about where the data was obtained. Include URLs, descriptions of data collection methods, and context about the data provider.
    -   **Acquisition Details**: Dates of data collection or acquisition. Note any steps taken to obtain the data.

### 2. Codebooks

-   **Purpose**: Explain the variables within the data files.
-   **Contents**:
    -   **Variable Definitions**: Detailed descriptions of each variable. Include names, types, and coding schemes.
    -   **Value Labels**: Explanation of the values variables can take, particularly for categorical variables.
    -   **Measurement Units**: Information about units of measurement for quantitative variables.
    -   **Additional Notes**: Other relevant information. This might include changes over time or specific data collection methods.

## Guidelines

-   **Thorough Documentation**: Make metadata comprehensive and detailed. This allows other researchers to fully understand and replicate the study.
-   **Clarity and Consistency**: Use clear and consistent terminology and formatting throughout. This makes metadata easier to comprehend and use.
-   **Updating Metadata**: If changes are made to the data, update the metadata. Keep it accurate.
