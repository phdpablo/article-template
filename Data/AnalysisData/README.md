# AnalysisData Folder

## Overview

The `AnalysisData` folder stores data files that have been processed and are ready for analysis. These files originate from the raw data in the `InputData` folder. They include all necessary transformations, cleaning, and modifications. This folder also contains a complete definition and/or coding scheme, basic summary statistics, and a visualization of the distribution for every variable in your Analysis Data Files.

## Contents

### 1. Analysis Data Files

-   **Purpose**: Store processed data files ready for analysis.
-   **Description**: These files have undergone necessary transformations and cleaning. They represent the data in a format suitable for conducting analyses.

### 2. The Data Appendix

-   **Purpose**: Provide detailed documentation of the processed data files.
-   **Contents**:
    -   **Modification Logs**: Detailed records of all transformations, cleaning steps, and modifications applied to the raw data.
    -   **Rationale**: Explanation of the reasons behind each modification. This ensures transparency and reproducibility.
    -   **File Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of each processed data file. Include structure, variables, and changes from the original raw data.

## Guidelines

-   **Documentation**: Document every modification to the raw data in the Data Appendix. Include specific changes, tools and methods used, and the rationale.
-   **Data Integrity**: Maintain data integrity and accuracy throughout processing. Document and address any errors or anomalies found during processing.
-   **Consistency**: Use consistent file naming conventions and data formats across all analysis data files. This facilitates easy use and understanding.
