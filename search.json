    "text": "Roadmap for Developing a Dynamic and Reproducible Research Article\nPablo Rogers\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis document is a deployment of the TIER Protocol 4.0: Dynamic Template. It serves as an example of how the template can be used and showcases its features. This template provides a structured framework for creating dynamic and fully reproducible research articles using Quarto, integrated with RStudio, Git/GitHub, and designed for sharing on platforms like OSF and GitHub Pages.\nThe template is organized according to the TIER Protocol 4.0, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. It is pre-configured for environment management using renv and Docker, guaranteeing that the computational environment is consistent and reproducible. This example demonstrates the integration of narrative text, executable R code, and outputs (like tables and figures) within a single, cohesive document.\nThis deployment illustrates the project structure and the use of Quarto’s book format. It is not a research article on a specific topic but a guide on how to use the template itself.\nKey-words: Open Science, Reproducibility, Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, R language, RStudio, Git, GitHub, renv, Docker, GitHub Pages.\nHow cite this template?\nLimongi, R., & Rogers, P.

    "text": "This section introduces the TIER Protocol 4.0 Dynamic Template. This is not an introduction to a research topic, but rather an explanation of the template’s purpose and structure.\nThis template is designed for researchers, particularly in the applied social sciences, who want to create dynamic and reproducible research articles. It aims to make the principles of reproducible research more accessible by providing a pre-structured project environment.\nThe template integrates several key tools and practices:\n\nQuarto Book: For authoring dynamic documents that seamlessly blend narrative text, executable code (R), and the resulting outputs (tables, figures). This document you are reading is an example of a Quarto book.\nTIER Protocol 4.0: Provides a standardized folder structure (Data/, Scripts/, Output/) to organize your project logically and transparently, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and reproduce your work.\nGit/GitHub: Built-in version control allows you to track changes to your project over time, facilitating collaboration and providing a history of your work.\nEnvironment Control: The template supports three levels of environment management:\n\nProper Reproducibility: Using the R renv package to snapshot and restore specific versions of R packages.\nFull Reproducibility (Recommended): Using Docker (see docker/ folder) to containerize the entire computational environment (R, RStudio, Quarto, packages, LaTeX). This ensures that your project runs identically on any machine with Docker installed, eliminating “it works on my machine” issues.\n\nEasy Sharing: Pre-configured for publishing your dynamic article to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and designed for sharing on the Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\nThis example document demonstrates how these components work together. Gain some additional knowledge regarding Open Science and Reproducible Research (Kathawalla et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2018; Limongi & Rogers, 2025a, 2025b).\nThis is an example of how to integrate an external document into your article (Figure 1.1), showcasing the TIER Protocol 4.0 folder structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: TIER Protocol 4.0: Quarto Reproducible Dynamic Template.

    "text": "This section provides background on the concepts of reproducibility and the tools integrated into this template.\nReproducible research is a cornerstone of good scientific practice. It ensures that findings are reliable and that the scientific process is transparent. The tools and structure provided by this template are designed to support these principles.\nMake sure to look into the thought of reproducible research practice (Dogucu & Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2022; Gilroy & Kaplan, 2019; Limongi & Rogers, 2025a, 2025b; Sullivan et al., 2019; Vuorre & Curley, 2018; Wiebels & Moreau, 2021; Wilson et al., 2017).\nUnderstanding Reproducibility Levels:\nThe template is designed to support different levels of reproducibility, as illustrated in the project’s Zenodo record:\n\nMinimal Reproducibility: Using the template structure, editing READMEs, and sharing on OSF.\nProper Reproducibility: Adding Quarto narrative (with RStudio and Git/Github) development and using renv for R package management.\nFull Reproducibility (This Template’s Strength): Incorporating Docker to containerize the entire computational environment, ensuring maximum consistency and ease of replication. This is achieved using the files in the docker/ folder.\n\nThe Role of Dynamic Documents:\nDynamic documents, like the ones created with Quarto (.qmd files), play a crucial role. They allow the narrative of your research to be directly linked to the analysis code. When you render the document, the code is executed, and the results (tables, figures, numbers) are automatically inserted into the text. This reduces manual errors and ensures that your narrative always reflects the latest analysis.\nTIER Protocol 4.0 Structure:\nThe folder structure adheres to the TIER Protocol 4.0:\n\nData/: Stores raw, intermediate, and final data files.\nScripts/: Contains R scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Complex analyses are best kept here.\nOutput/: Stores generated results like tables, figures, and intermediate data files.\ndocs/ (Root): Contains the final rendered output (HTML, PDF) for web publication.\nRoot: Contains main narrative files (index.qmd, 01-intro.qmd, etc.), project configuration (_quarto.yml), bibliography (references.bib), and CSL style file (apa7ed.csl).\n\nThis structure promotes clarity and makes it easier for others to navigate your project.\n\n\n\n\nDogucu, M., & Çetinkaya-Rundel, M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This section describes the tools and methods used to create and utilize this template.\nThis template itself is the “method”. It prescribes a specific way to organize and execute a reproducible research project.\nCore Technologies:\n\nQuarto: The primary authoring tool. It uses Markdown syntax for text and integrates executable code chunks (primarily R, but also Python, Julia, etc.). Key features used:\n\nBook Format: Organizes the article into chapters/sections.\nCode Chunks: Embed R code directly ({r}) for analysis and visualization.\nCitations: Managed via references.bib (BibTeX) and formatted using apa7ed.csl. You can use Zotero in RStudio for this.\nEmbedding Outputs: Results from scripts in Scripts/ can be embedded into the narrative using {{&lt; embed &gt;}} (see Results section).\n\nR & RStudio: The computational engine and integrated development environment (IDE). R/RStudio is used for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and creating visualizations within Quarto documents.\nGit & GitHub:\n\nGit: Provides version control locally. Every significant change to your project files is tracked.\nGitHub: Hosts the repository online, enabling collaboration, sharing, backup, and to publish the dynamic document (Github Pages). It also integrates with GitHub Actions.\n\nEnvironment Management:\n\nrenv: (Proper Reproducibility) Tracks and restores specific R package versions used in the project. The renv.lock file is the key component.\nDocker: (Full Reproducibility) Packages the entire software environment (R, RStudio, Quarto, packages, LaTeX) into a container. This guarantees that the environment is identical for anyone running the project. The docker/ folder contains the necessary configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, start/stop scripts).\n\nSharing & Publication:\n\nOSF: A platform for registering, storing, and sharing research materials openly.\nGitHub Pages: A free service to host the rendered HTML version of your Quarto book/article directly from your GitHub repository. The .github/workflows/deploy.yml file automates this process.\n\n\nWorkflow Integration:\nIf you need to learn a little more about Reproducible Research with R/RStudio, there are excellent free e-books:\n\nR for Data Science\nBuilding reproducible analytical pipelines with R\nThe Open Science Manual: Make Your Scientific Research Accessible and Reproducible\n\nThe typical workflow using this template for Full Reproducibility involves:\n\nSetting up the environment using Docker (docker/start.sh or start.bat).\nWorking within the RStudio container to edit .qmd files, run code chunks, and manage R packages (tracked by renv).\nRendering the document using quarto render in the RStudio Terminal.\nStopping the Docker environment when done (docker/stop.sh or stop.bat).\nUsing Git locally to commit and push changes to your GitHub repository.\nOptionally, pushing to the main branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish the updated HTML site to GitHub Pages.",

    "text": "The text below is intended to be an instructive example…\n\nRemember that the dynamic document’s sole purpose is to provide analytical findings. This approach allows each analysis step to be defined and controlled separately from the dynamic document. In this sense, the scripts are the source of the results, and the dynamic document is the published article. There could be a few more analyses in the scripts that haven’t been released yet, but anyone who wants to go deeper into the work that went into the article can audit them.\nBecause of this, you have to demonstrate in the scripts how you got to where you are, even if you should only include information that you think is essential in the article’s body. See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html for information on how to embed the output of another Quarto document to prevent code duplication. Below is an example of how you can proceed.\n\nInclude tables, graphs, figures, and other visual aids from your scripts in the AnalysisScripts folder as you write up your narrative. To learn how to complete this integration, look to Quarto’s documentation embedding.\nI’ve included two examples of how to include results from your analytic scripts into your story below: Figure 4.1 and Table 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Diamonds characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarat\ncut\ncolor\nclarity\ndepth\ntable\nprice\nx\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n0.23\nIdeal\nE\nSI2\n61.5\n55\n326\n3.95\n3.98\n2.43\n\n\n0.21\nPremium\nE\nSI1\n59.8\n61\n326\n3.89\n3.84\n2.31\n\n\n0.23\nGood\nE\nVS1\n56.9\n65\n327\n4.05\n4.07\n2.31\n\n\n0.29\nPremium\nI\nVS2\n62.4\n58\n334\n4.20\n4.23\n2.63\n\n\n0.31\nGood\nJ\nSI2\n63.3\n58\n335\n4.34\n4.35\n2.75\n\n\n0.24\nVery Good\nJ\nVVS2\n62.8\n57\n336\n3.94\n3.96\n2.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn how it was done, follow the code!

    "text": "This section summarizes the purpose and benefits of the TIER Protocol 4.0 Dynamic Template.\nThis template provides a comprehensive and structured pathway for researchers to create dynamic, reproducible research articles. By integrating tools like Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, Git, and Docker, it addresses the core requirements for modern, transparent, and robust scientific communication.\nAlthough your project must be auditable and replicable by your scripts and data, keep in mind that not everything in your scripts needs to be explicitly shown in your main narrative document. You can maintain detailed analysis workflows in the Scripts/ folder. The main narrative (.qmd files) should focus on the story you are trying to tell, embedding only the most critical results and insights.\nThe key advantages of using this template are:\n\nEnhanced Reproducibility: The combination of TIER structure, renv, and especially Docker ensures that your work can be replicated exactly by others.\nImproved Organization: The predefined folder structure makes projects easier to navigate and understand.\nStreamlined Workflow: Integration with RStudio and Quarto provides a smooth environment for writing, coding, and publishing.\nEasy Sharing and Publishing: Built-in support for GitHub Pages and OSF facilitates open science practices.\nReduced Setup Time: Researchers can start new projects quickly with a pre-configured environment.\n\nThis template is a practical tool for implementing the principles of reproducible research and open science. It lowers the technical barriers, allowing researchers to focus on their core research questions while ensuring best practices for transparency and replication are followed.",
