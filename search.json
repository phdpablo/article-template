It serves as an example of how the template can be used and showcases its features. This template provides a structured framework for creating dynamic and fully reproducible research articles using Quarto, integrated with RStudio, Git/GitHub, and designed for sharing on platforms like OSF and GitHub Pages.\nThe template is organized according to the TIER Protocol 4.0, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. It is pre-configured for environment management using renv and Docker, guaranteeing that the computational environment is consistent and reproducible. This example demonstrates the integration of narrative text, executable R code, and outputs (like tables and figures) within a single, cohesive document.\nThis deployment illustrates the project structure and the use of Quarto’s book format. It is not a research article on a specific topic but a guide on how to use the template itself.\nKey-words: Open Science, Reproducibility, Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, R language, RStudio, Git, GitHub, renv package, Docker, GitHub Pages, OSF.\n\n\n\nHow cite this template?\nRogers, P., & Limongi, R.

    "text": "This section introduces the ARTE: Article Reproducibility Template & Environment. This is not an introduction to a research topic, but rather an explanation of the template’s purpose and structure.\nThis template is designed for researchers, particularly in the applied social sciences, who want to create dynamic and reproducible research articles. It aims to make the principles of reproducible research more accessible by providing a pre-structured project environment.\nThe template integrates several key tools and practices:\n\nQuarto’s book: For authoring dynamic documents that seamlessly blend narrative text, executable code (R), and the resulting outputs (tables, figures). This document you are reading is an example of a Quarto book.\nTIER Protocol 4.0: Provides a standardized folder structure (Data/, Scripts/, Output/) to organize your project logically and transparently, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and reproduce your work.\nGit/GitHub: Built-in version control allows you to track changes to your project over time, facilitating collaboration and providing a history of your work.\nEnvironment Control: The template supports three levels of environment management:\n\nProper Reproducibility: Using the R renv package to snapshot and restore specific versions of R packages.\nFull Reproducibility (Recommended): Using Docker (see docker/ folder) to containerize the entire computational environment (R, RStudio, Quarto, packages, LaTeX). This ensures that your project runs identically on any machine with Docker installed, eliminating “it works on my machine” issues.\n\nGitHub Pages: Pre-configured for publishing your dynamic article using GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and designed for sharing on the Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\nThis example document demonstrates how these components work together. Gain some additional knowledge regarding Open Science and Reproducible Research (Kathawalla et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2018; Limongi & Rogers, 2025a, 2025b; Rogers & Limongi, 2025).\nThis is an example of how to integrate an external document into your article (Figure 1.1), showcasing the TIER Protocol 4.0 folder structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: ARTE (Article Reproducibility Template & Environment) workflow folder structure.

R/RStudio is used for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and creating visualizations within Quarto documents.\nGit & GitHub:\n\nGit: Provides version control locally. Every significant change to your project files is tracked.\nGitHub: Hosts the repository online, enabling collaboration, sharing, backup, and to publish the dynamic document (Github Pages). It also integrates with GitHub Actions.\n\nEnvironment Management:\n\nrenv: (Proper Reproducibility) Tracks and restores specific R package versions used in the project.

This separation keeps the main narrative document focused and clean.\nThe Scripts/AnalysisScripts/data_visualization.qmd file contains example R code for generating plots and tables. Below, we embed the outputs from specific code chunks within that script directly into this narrative.\nI’ve included two examples of how to include results from your analytic scripts into your story below: Figure 4.1 and Table 4.1.

By integrating tools like Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, Git/GitHub, and Docker, it addresses the core requirements for modern, transparent, and robust scientific communication.\nAlthough your project must be auditable and replicable by your scripts and data, keep in mind that not everything in your scripts needs to be explicitly shown in your main narrative document. You can maintain detailed analysis workflows in the Scripts/ folder. The main narrative (.qmd files) should focus on the story you are trying to tell, embedding only the most critical results and insights.\nThe key advantages of using this template are:\n\nEnhanced Reproducibility: The combination of renv package and Docker ensures that your work can be replicated exactly by others.\nImproved Organization: The predefined folder structure (TIER Protocol 4.0) makes projects easier to navigate and understand.\nStreamlined Workflow: Integration with RStudio and Quarto provides a smooth environment for writing, coding, and publishing.\nEasy Sharing and Publishing: Built-in support for GitHub Pages and OSF facilitates open science practices.\nReduced Setup Time: Researchers can start new projects quickly with a pre-configured environment.\n\nThis template is a practical tool for implementing the principles of reproducible research and open science. It lowers the technical barriers, allowing researchers to focus on their core research questions while ensuring best practices for transparency and replication are followed.",
