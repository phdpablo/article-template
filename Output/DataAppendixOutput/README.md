# DataAppendixOutput Folder

## Overview

The `DataAppendixOutput` folder stores the final documentation products that detail the Data Appendix. There should be a direct match between the output displayed in your Data Appendix and the files in this `DataAppendixOutput` folder:

-   Each output element used in your Data Appendix should be found in one of the files here.
-   Each file in this directory should contribute content presented in your Data Appendix.

## Contents

-   **Data Appendix Files**: Detailed documentation files. They describe data sources, processing steps, transformations, and final analysis datasets. These files are typically generated by the `DataAppendixScripts`.
-   **Supporting Documentation**: Additional files that support understanding the Data Appendix. This might include methodological notes, transformation logs, and codebooks.

## Guidelines

-   **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names for Data Appendix files. Names should indicate content and purpose. Examples: `data_appendix_main.pdf`, `transformation_log.xlsx`, `variable_definitions.txt`.
-   **Documentation**: Document each file thoroughly. Explain its purpose, contents, and important considerations.
    -   **Header Comments**: For text files, include a header. List the file name, author, date, and a brief content description.
    -   **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions within files. Explain each aspect of data processing and analysis.
-   **Organization**: Organize files logically. This facilitates easy access and understanding. Group related files together. Use subfolders if necessary.
-   **Version Control**: Use version control for these files. Record major changes and maintain a version history.
