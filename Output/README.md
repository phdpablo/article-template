# Output Folder

## Overview

The `Output` folder contains the final results and products of the data analysis. This includes tables, figures, statistical outputs, and any other materials generated as part of the analysis process. Proper organization and documentation of these outputs are essential for ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of the research findings.

## Contents

- **Final Results**: This includes all tables, figures, and statistical outputs generated from the analysis scripts.
- **Reports and Summaries**: Any reports or summaries that synthesize the results and provide interpretations or conclusions.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for the output files to indicate their contents and the analysis they pertain to. For example, `regression_results.csv`, `summary_statistics.txt`, `data_visualization.png`.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each output file is accompanied by documentation that explains its contents, how it was generated, and any important considerations or limitations.
  - **Header Comments**: For text-based outputs, include a header with the file's name, author, date, and a brief description of its contents.
  - **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments within scripts that generate outputs to explain specific lines or sections of code that produce important results.
- **Organization**: Keep output files organized in subfolders if necessary to categorize different types of outputs (e.g., `Tables`, `Figures`, `Statistics`).
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to track changes in output files. Document major changes and maintain a history of output versions.
