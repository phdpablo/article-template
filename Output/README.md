# Output Folder

## Overview

The `Output` folder stores the final results and products of the data analysis. This includes tables, figures, statistical outputs, and other materials generated during the analysis. Organizing and documenting these outputs properly is essential for research transparency and reproducibility.

## Contents

-   **Final Results**: All tables, figures, and statistical outputs created by the analysis scripts.
-   **Reports and Summaries**: Reports or summaries that interpret the results and present conclusions.

## Guidelines

-   **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names. Names should indicate the content and related analysis. Examples: `regression_results.csv`, `summary_statistics.txt`, `data_visualization.png`.
-   **Documentation**: Document each output file. Explain its content, how it was generated, and important considerations.
    -   **Header Comments**: For text files, include a header. List the file name, author, date, and a brief content description.
    -   **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments in scripts. Explain specific lines or sections that produce key results.
-   **Organization**: Organize output files with subfolders if needed. This helps categorize different types (e.g., `Tables`, `Figures`, `Statistics`).
-   **Version Control**: Use version control for output files. Record major changes and maintain a version history.
