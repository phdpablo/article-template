# Results Folder

## Overview

The `Results` folder stores the final results from the data analysis. This includes all tables, figures, statistical outputs, and other materials that present the research findings. Organizing and documenting these results properly is crucial for transparency, reproducibility, and clarity.

## Contents

You can split this folder into smaller ones if needed. Here are common subfolders for the `Results` directory:

-   **Tables**: Stores all tables from the analysis. These present detailed numerical results and statistical summaries.
-   **Figures**: Includes all graphical representations. This covers charts, graphs, and plots that visualize findings.
-   **Statistical Outputs**: Holds outputs from statistical analyses. This includes regression models, hypothesis tests, and other evaluations.
-   **Reports and Summaries**: Contains comprehensive reports or summaries. These synthesize analysis results, offering interpretations and conclusions.

## Guidelines

-   **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names for result files. Names should indicate content and related analysis. Examples: `regression_results.csv`, `summary_statistics.txt`, `data_visualization.png`.
-   **Documentation**: Document each result file. Explain its content, how it was generated, and important considerations.
    -   **Header Comments**: For text files, include a header. List the file name, author, date, and a brief content description.
    -   **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments in scripts. Explain specific lines or sections that produce key results.
-   **Organization**: Organize result files with subfolders if needed. This helps categorize different types (e.g., `Tables`, `Figures`, `Statistics`).
-   **Reproducibility**: Ensure each result can be reproduced. Run the corresponding analysis scripts with the same input data. Document dependencies or software requirements.
