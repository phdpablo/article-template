# Results Folder

## Overview

The `Results` folder contains the final results generated from the data analysis. This includes all tables, figures, statistical outputs, and any other materials that present the findings of the research project. Proper organization and documentation of these results are crucial for ensuring the transparency, reproducibility, and comprehensibility of the research outcomes.

## Contents

If further organization is required, you can split this folder up into smaller ones. Here are some common subfolders that you might consider creating within the `Results` folder:

- **Tables**: This subfolder contains all the tables generated from the analysis, presenting detailed numerical results and statistical summaries.
- **Figures**: This subfolder includes all the graphical representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and plots that visualize the research findings.
- **Statistical Outputs**: This subfolder holds the outputs of statistical analyses, including regression models, hypothesis tests, and other statistical evaluations.
- **Reports and Summaries**: This subfolder contains any comprehensive reports or summaries that synthesize the analysis results, providing interpretations, conclusions, and discussions.

## Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for the result files to indicate their contents and the analysis they pertain to. For example, `regression_results.csv`, `summary_statistics.txt`, `data_visualization.png`.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each result file is accompanied by documentation that explains its contents, how it was generated, and any important considerations or limitations.
  - **Header Comments**: For text-based outputs, include a header with the file's name, author, date, and a brief description of its contents.
  - **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments within scripts that generate outputs to explain specific lines or sections of code that produce important results.
- **Organization**: Keep result files organized in subfolders if necessary to categorize different types of results (e.g., `Tables`, `Figures`, `Statistics`).
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that each result can be reproduced by running the corresponding analysis scripts with the same input data. Document any dependencies or software requirements needed to generate the results.
