# Introduction

<br>

This section introduces the **ARTE: Article Reproducibility Template & Environment**. This is not an introduction to a research topic, but rather an explanation of the template's purpose and structure.

This template is designed for researchers, particularly in the applied social sciences, who want to create **dynamic and reproducible research articles**. It aims to make the principles of reproducible research more accessible by providing a pre-structured project environment.

The template integrates several key tools and practices:

-   **Quarto Book:** For authoring dynamic documents that seamlessly blend narrative text, executable code (R), and the resulting outputs (tables, figures). *This document you are reading is an example of a Quarto book*.

-   **TIER Protocol 4.0:** Provides a standardized folder structure (`Data/`, `Scripts/`, `Output/`) to organize your project logically and transparently, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and reproduce your work.

-   **Git/GitHub:** Built-in version control allows you to track changes to your project over time, facilitating collaboration and providing a history of your work.

-   **Environment Control:** The template supports three levels of environment management:

    -   **Proper Reproducibility:** Using the R `renv` package to snapshot and restore specific versions of R packages.
    -   **Full Reproducibility (Recommended):** Using **Docker** (see `docker/` folder) to containerize the entire computational environment (R, RStudio, Quarto, packages, LaTeX). This ensures that your project runs identically on any machine with Docker installed, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.

-   **Easy Sharing:** Pre-configured for publishing your dynamic article to **GitHub Pages** using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) and designed for sharing on the **Open Science Framework (OSF)**.

This example document demonstrates how these components work together. Gain some additional knowledge regarding Open Science and Reproducible Research [@klein2018; @kathawalla2021; @limongi2025a; @limongi2025b].

This is an example of how to integrate an external document into your article (@fig-arte-folders), showcasing the TIER Protocol 4.0 folder structure.
