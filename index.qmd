# Abstract {.unnumbered .unlisted}

<br>

This document is a deployment of the **TIER Protocol 4.0: Dynamic Template**. It serves as an example of how the template can be used and showcases its features. This template provides a structured framework for creating **dynamic and fully reproducible research articles** using **Quarto**, integrated with **RStudio**, **Git/GitHub**, and designed for sharing on platforms like **OSF** and **GitHub Pages**.

The template is organized according to the **TIER Protocol 4.0**, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. It is pre-configured for **environment management** using `renv` and **Docker**, guaranteeing that the computational environment is consistent and reproducible. This example demonstrates the integration of narrative text, executable R code, and outputs (like tables and figures) within a single, cohesive document.

This deployment illustrates the project structure and the use of Quarto's book format. It is not a research article on a specific topic but a guide on how to use the template itself.

**Key-words:** Open Science, Reproducibility, Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, R language, RStudio, Git, GitHub, renv, Docker, GitHub Pages.
