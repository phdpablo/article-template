# Abstract {.unnumbered .unlisted}

<br>

This document is a deployment of the **ARTE: Article Reproducibility Template & Environment**. It serves as an example of how the template can be used and showcases its features. This template provides a structured framework for creating **dynamic and fully reproducible research articles** using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org), integrated with [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), [**Git/GitHub**](https://git-scm.com/), and designed for sharing on platforms like [**OSF**](https://osf.io/) and [**GitHub Pages**](https://docs.github.com/pages).

The template is organized according to the [**TIER Protocol 4.0**](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/), ensuring clarity and reproducibility. It is pre-configured for environment management using [**renv**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), guaranteeing that the computational environment is consistent and reproducible. This example demonstrates the integration of narrative text, executable R code, and outputs (like tables and figures) within a single, cohesive document.

This deployment illustrates the project structure and the use of [**Quarto's book format**](https://quarto.org/docs/books/). It is not a research article on a specific topic but a guide on how to use the template itself.

**Key-words:** Open Science, Reproducibility, Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, R language, RStudio, Git, GitHub, renv package, Docker, GitHub Pages.
