# Results

The text below is intended to be an instructive example...

-   Remember that the dynamic document's sole purpose is to provide analytical findings. This approach allows each analysis step to be defined and controlled separately from the dynamic document. In this sense, the scripts are the source of the results, and the dynamic document is the published article. There could be a few more analyses in the scripts that haven't been released yet, but anyone who wants to go deeper into the work that went into the article can audit them.

-   Because of this, you have to demonstrate in the scripts how you got to where you are, even if you should only include information that you think is essential in the article's body. See <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html> for information on how to embed the output of another Quarto document to prevent code duplication. Below is an example of how you can proceed.

Include tables, graphs, figures, and other visual aids from your scripts in the `AnalysisScripts` folder as you write up your narrative. To learn how to complete this integration, look to [Quarto's documentation embedding](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html).

I've included two examples of how to include results from your analytic scripts into your story below: @fig-pressure and @tbl-diamonds.

{{< embed /Scripts/AnalysisScripts/data_visualization.qmd#fig-pressure >}}

{{< embed /Scripts/AnalysisScripts/data_visualization.qmd#tbl-diamonds >}}

To learn how it was done, follow the code! Please take note that I was only referring to the output that was suggested in the `data_visualization.qmd` script located in the `Scripts/AnalysisScripts` folder. You can refer to the script for more information.
