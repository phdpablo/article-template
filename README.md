This repository provides a template for creating a **dynamic and fully reproducible research article** using **Quarto**, **RStudio**, the **TIER Protocol 4.0**, and **Docker**. It offers a structured project organization, integrates seamlessly with Git/GitHub for version control, and is configured for easy publication on **GitHub Pages** and **OSF**.

The template is designed to meet the **Full Reproducibility** standard by encapsulating the entire computational environment, including R, R packages (managed by `renv`), and LaTeX dependencies, within a Docker container. This ensures that your research can be replicated exactly, regardless of the user's local machine setup.

The folder structure of the repository is summarized in the picture below, and more information may be found in its deployment, which serves as a showcase: <https://phdpablo.github.io/article-template/>.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before using this template for **Full Reproducibility**, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1.  **Git (Optional):** For cloning the repository and version control. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **Docker:** For creating and running the reproducible environment. [Download Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure it is running.

> **Note for Users with Lower Computational Literacy:** This template aims to simplify the process. The core requirement is having Docker installed and running. The provided scripts handle the rest.

## Quick Start (Using Docker - Recommended) {#quick-start-using-docker---recommended}

This method uses the pre-configured Docker setup for the easiest and most reproducible experience.

1.  **Get the Template:**
    -   **Use as Template (Recommended):** Click the green "Use this template" button on the GitHub repository page, name your new repository, and choose its visibility (Public/Private).
    -   **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
    -   **Download ZIP:** If you don't have Git installed, click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Extract the folder.
2.  **Navigate to the Docker Directory:**
    -   Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal)
        -   Change directory (`cd`) into the `docker` folder of your cloned/downloaded project: `cd path/to/your/project/docker`
    -   Or open the `docker` folder in your file explorer.
3.  **Start the Environment:**
    -   **Windows:** Double-click `start.bat`.
    -   **macOS/Linux:** Run `./start.sh` (you might need `chmod +x start.sh` first).
    -   This script automatically finds an available port, builds the Docker image (if needed), starts a container with the name of the folder you cloned/downloaded, and opens RStudio in your browser.
4.  **Access RStudio:**
    -   Your browser should automatically open RStudio at `http://ip_host:8787`. If not, go to your browser.
    -   You are logged in automatically as the `rstudio` user.
    -   Your project files are located in `/home/rstudio/project`.
5.  **Start Working:**
    -   Open `article-template.Rproj`. Rename it to your project name if you wish.
    -   Navigate to and open the Quarto files (e.g., `index.qmd`, `01-intro.qmd`).
    -   Edit, run code chunks, and render your project using `quarto render` in the RStudio Terminal. You can also use the Render button in RStudio.
6.  **Stop the Environment:**
    -   When finished:
        -   **Windows:** Double-click `stop.bat`.
        -   **macOS/Linux:** Run `./stop.sh`.

## Setup, Build, and Run (Detailed Docker Steps) {#setup-build-and-run-detailed-docker-steps}

If you prefer manual control or want to understand the process:

1.  **Navigate:** Open a terminal and `cd` into the `docker` directory of your project.
2.  **(Optional) Build the Image:**
    -   If you want to explicitly build the image first: `docker-compose build`
3.  **Run the Container:**
    -   Start the container in detached mode: `docker-compose up -d`
    -   The `docker-compose.yml` file handles port mapping, volume mounting for persistence, and setting environment variables.
4.  **Stop the Container:**
    -   To stop and remove the container: `docker-compose down`

## Accessing the RStudio Environment {#accessing-the-rstudio-environment}

-   **URL:** `http://ip_host:8787` (The `start` scripts automatically open this).
-   **Authentication:** No login required (`DISABLE_AUTH=true`).
-   **User:** You are logged in as the `rstudio` user.
-   **Project Location (in Container):** `/home/rstudio/project` (This is your local project folder mounted inside the container).

## Daily Workflow {#daily-workflow}

1.  **Start:** Use `docker/start.bat` or `docker/start.sh`.
2.  **Work in RStudio:**
    -   Open `article-template.Rproj` or `.Rproj` file that you renamed.
    -   Edit `.qmd` files.
    -   Run R code chunks directly in the `.qmd` files or in the R console.
    -   Install new R packages using `install.packages()`. `renv` will track them.
    -   Use `renv::snapshot()` to update `renv.lock` when you add new packages.
    -   Use `quarto render` in the Terminal to build your outputs (HTML, PDF).
3.  **Stop:** Use `docker/stop.bat` or `docker/stop.sh` when done.

## Environment Features {#environment-features}

-   **Base Image:** `rocker/verse:4.5.1` (Includes R, RStudio Server, Quarto, Pandoc, TinyTeX).
-   **R Package Management:** `renv` is pre-configured.
    -   **Library Path:** `/renv/library` (Mounted as a Docker volume for persistence).
    -   **Cache Path:** `/renv/cache` (Mounted as a Docker volume for faster reinstalls and sharing between projects).
    -   **Packages:** Core packages defined in `renv.lock` are restored during the Docker image build for the first render.
-   **LaTeX/TinyTeX:** Essential LaTeX packages (`amsfonts`, `unicode-math`, `booktabs`, `caption`, `float`) are pre-installed in the Docker image.
-   **Data Persistence:** Your project directory (`..` relative to `docker/`) is mounted to `/home/rstudio/project`.
-   **RStudio Settings Persistence:** RStudio configuration (`.config`, `.local`, `.rstudio`, `.R`) is stored in `docker/cache/` and mounted into the container, preserving your layout and preferences per project.
-   **Port Management:** The `start` scripts automatically find an open port starting from 8787.

## Useful Commands {#useful-commands}

-   **Inside RStudio Terminal:**
    -   `quarto render`: Render the entire book/project.
    -   `quarto render report.qmd`: Render a specific file.
    -   `source("render_cleanup.R")`: Run the post-render cleanup script.
-   **In your Host Terminal (inside `docker/` directory):**
    -   `docker-compose up -d`: Start the container.
    -   `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove the container.
    -   `docker-compose build`: Rebuild the Docker image.
    -   `docker-compose logs`: View container logs.
    -   `docker volume ls`: List Docker volumes (to see `renv_cache`, `renv_library`).
    -   `docker volume prune`: Remove unused Docker volumes (use with caution).

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

-   **Docker not running:** Ensure the Docker Desktop application (or Docker daemon on Linux) is started.
-   **Port in use:** The `start` scripts automatically find the next available port. Check the terminal output for the URL.
-   **Permission denied (Linux/macOS):** Make the scripts executable: `chmod +x docker/start.sh docker/stop.sh`.
-   **Container fails to start:**
    -   Check Docker logs: `cd docker && docker-compose logs`.
    -   Ensure the `docker` directory is your current working directory when running `docker-compose` commands.
-   **Packages not found after restart:** Ensure `renv` is activated (opening `article-template.Rproj` usually does this) and run `renv::restore()` if needed.
-   **RStudio settings not persisting:** Ensure the `docker/cache` directory exists and has the correct permissions.

## Publishing Your Article {#publishing-your-article}

This template is configured for easy publication on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

1.  **Ensure GitHub Pages Source is Set:**
    -   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    -   Navigate to **Settings** \> **Pages**.
    -   Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
    -   Select **Branch:** `gh-pages` and **Path:** `/ (root)`.
    -   Click **Save**.
2.  **Render Your Site:**
    -   In RStudio (within the Docker container), run `quarto render`. This generates the HTML files into the `docs/` directory.
3.  **Commit and Push:**
    -   Commit your changes (including the updated `docs/` folder and potentially `renv.lock` if you added packages) locally.
    -   Push the changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
4.  **Trigger Deployment:**
    -   The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automatically runs on pushes to `main`.
    -   It builds the site and pushes the contents of `docs/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
5.  **View Your Site:**
    -   After the workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.

## Important Notes {#important-notes}

-   **Project Structure:** The main narrative files (`.qmd`) and configuration (`_quarto.yml`, `references.bib`, etc.) are in the **root** of the repository. Docker mounts this root directory to `/home/rstudio/project` inside the container.
-   **Docker Context:** The `docker-compose.yml` uses `..` (the project root) as the build context, allowing the Dockerfile to access files like `renv.lock`.
-   **renv:** This template relies heavily on `renv` for reproducibility. Familiarize yourself with its basic usage (`snapshot`, `restore`).
-   **Git Integration:** While the Docker environment provides isolation, you should still use Git locally on your host machine for version control of your project files.
-   **Administrative Files:** The `Adm/` folder is intended for administrative files and is ignored by Git (via `.gitignore`) and not published to GitHub Pages.
